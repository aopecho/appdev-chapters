# Installing locally

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces){:target="_blank"} are a wonderful solution for getting up and running with a project quickly. You don't have to install anything on your own machine, which means you can work from any device — a Chromebook, a work-issued laptop, even an iPad. You can instantaneously dive into any codebase, for example when code reviewing a colleague's PR, without having to worry about Ruby or gem version conflicts with whatever you're working on ("[dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell){:target="_blank"}").

But there are drawbacks to using cloud-based development environments, and at some point you're going to want to install Ruby and Rails on your own machine. Some benefits of local installation:

 - You can run `rails new` yourself to generate a brand new application.
 - Your computer probably has vastly more CPU and memory than Gitpod instances.
 - You can work offline, like when you're on an airplane.
 - You can use other text editors, like [JetBrains' excellent RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students){:target="_blank"}.
 - While [it's possible](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/native-ui-with-vnc/) to develop native desktop/mobile applications in Gitpod, it's a little clunky. It's probably better to develop native apps locally.
