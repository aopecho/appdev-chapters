# CSS Cheatsheet

## Basic Syntax

CSS is made up of **style rules**.

A **style rule** is constructed from a <u>selector</u> and a <u>declaration block</u>. The general structure looks like:

```css
h1 {
  color: maroon;
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

The **selector** identifies which elements you want to style. 

A **declaration block** is made up of one or more **declarations**, which are separated by semicolons (`;`).

A declaration is comprised of a **property** and a **value** separated by a colon (`:`).

## Selectors
Selectors are how we specify which HTML elements we want our style rule to apply to.
There are bunch of different selectors; for now we're going to dramatically simplify and only think about two: tag-type and class-level.

## Tag-type

Tag-type selectors target _all_ elements of a particular type, e.g. all `h1` or all `ul`:

```css
h1 {
  color: maroon;
  font-weight: 700;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding-left: none;
}
```

## Class-level
An attribute specifies additional information about the element. One or more attributes can be added inside the opening tag after the tag name. Attributes are usually structured as name/value pairs in the format `name="value"`.

For example:

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">
  Go to Wikipedia
</a>
```

Most attributes only make sense on specific elements.

For example:
- `href=""` is for `<a>` elements, to specify where to take the user when they click the link.
- `src=""` is for `<img>` elements, to specify the url of the image to load.
- `for=""` is for `<label>` elements, to specify which input element it is paired with.

Some attributes can be put on almost any element, like `class=""` or `id=""`. â€‹Any single `id` should only be used **once** per document. A class can and should be used repeatedly.

### Exceptions

There are a few elements that don't require content and therefore don't have a closing tag.

The most common ones are:
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<br>`
- `<hr>`
- `<meta>`
- `<link>`

### Nesting Elements

Elements can contain other elements. When that happens, the one inside is known as a **child element** and the one outside is the **parent element**.

If there are multiple levels of nesting, then all the elements inside an outer element are its _descendants_. Similarly, an element that contains other elements is referred to as an _ancestor_.

## Required Elements

There are required elements that every HTML page must have to be considered **valid**, according to [W3](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) HTML specifications.

### Doctype Declaration

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This must be **the very first line** in the file. It instructs the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

### `<html>` element

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
```

The `<html>` element is the ancestor of every other HTML element on the page (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration). It contains **exactly** two other elements: `<head>` and `<body>`.

### `<head>` element

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
</html>
```

This element contains information and instructions for the browser on how to process the document; things like what title or icon to put in the browser tab, what style sheets to load, what language to use, etc. 

### `<body>` element

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

This element contains all other elements and content that a user can see or interact with. It must be the second element inside of the parent `<html>` element, following only the `<head>` element.

## Types of Elements

### Block-level

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its parent element.

Common block-level elements include:
- `<div>`
- `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- `<p>`

### Inline

An inline elment does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

Common inline elements include:
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<span>`

<hr>
