## Setup

The starting point of this project is a blank Rails application. You need to create all the tables and models yourself!

We domain modeled this in first two weeks of class, but if need a refresher here's the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

If you add these columns _exactly_, then you can run the `rails dummy_data` Rake task to add dummy data to your database tables like with the homeworks.
