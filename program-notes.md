# A few program notes

Before we continue, I want to pause and discuss what, why, and how we're going to be learning.

Our goal is to build and deploy a fully-functional application, which will require that we learn a little bit about every part of the "stack" — the interface that users interact with all the way through to the server that the application runs on.

We're going to work from the inside-out. We'll start by learning how to manage information with a _database_, because that is the heart of any useful application. Then we're going to learn how to expose an _interface_ for users to get information in and out of our database — we'll be starting with a web app because that's the quickest way to get up and running, but we could add an iPhone or Android app later.

For all of the above, we're going to use the Ruby language. There are many languages we could have chosen, but Ruby has a lot of advantages for beginners:

 - Compared to other languages, Ruby is a pleasure to write. Here's Yukihiro Matsumoto (a.k.a. "Matz"), the creator of Ruby:

    > Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines.

 - Rails
 - Other libraries
 - Heroku




This is _not_ a course about a single programming language. We believe in [making learning whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719) — it's more useful to first experience a simplified version of the  to do a deep dive on one piece.



We'll start with repl.it in the browser

Then we'll move on to writing programs using Cloud9

We're going to focus on the database first


Then we'll add the interface

The wiring we build can support any client, but we're going to learn HTML for simplicity

We'll see some tricks for making it work well on phones

## Teaching philosophy

- Questions are where answers fit
- Make learning whole
