# The most minimal introduction to JavaScript

## History

Oh, JavaScript. Whipped together at Netscape in 1995, back during the Browser Wars; named "Java"Script to piggy-back on the "new" hotness of Java (despite having nothing to do with Java); and, through some historical, accident won the battle to become the third standard language of the web, along with HTML (for structure) and CSS (for style).

As the only scripting language that browsers run natively, it has by default become one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages, maybe _the_ most. However, like CSS, it can't undo mistakes in the design of the language (which was done, initially, in just 10 days) very often; in order to maintain backwards compatibility. Thankfully, also like CSS, JavaScript has made tremendous strides in the last 5-10 years in paving over the warts of the past with new features and getting them adopted across _most_ browsers so that, in 2021, it's quite nice to use.

## The very basics

For the very basics of JavaScript, I recommend this Scrimba course: [Introduction to JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/introtojavascript){:target="_blank"}. You should be able to watch it on 1.5x or 2x speed. Go ahead, I'll wait.

Welcome back! What did you think?

### This ain't your first rodeo

First of all, compare your experience learning JavaScript for the first time to when you learned Ruby for the first time. How did it feel this time around to learn about variables, string interpolation, arrays, arguments, `split`, etc?

So much easier, right? This was, for me, one of the best things about learning Ruby[^polyglot]. After learning (the friendly, welcoming) Ruby and building some applications in Rails, and through that getting a pretty good understanding of programming _concepts_ (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, methods, arguments, etc) ‚Äî my second language was _so much easier_, and the third was even easier still.

Conversely, every language has some distinct characteristics about it that will change the way you _think_ and make you better at your previous languages. Welcome to being a polyglot developer üôåüèæ 

[^polyglot] _Really_ good developers don't pigeonhole themselves into a single stack ‚Äî "I'm a Rails developer", "I use Mongo", "I use React". They can pick up any language that's needed, and they choose the best tool for the job at hand. Sure, they might have the most experience in a particular library already, and they might have a preference for one library over another if they both do the same job; but if a job calls for Phoenix, a good developer won't insist on using Rails just because they are familiar with it.
