# The most minimal introduction to JavaScript

## History

Oh, JavaScript. Whipped together at Netscape in 1995, back during the Browser Wars; named "Java"Script to piggy-back on the "new" hotness of Java (despite having nothing to do with Java); and, through some historical, accident won the battle to become the third standard language of the web, along with HTML (for structure) and CSS (for style).

As the only scripting language that browsers run natively, it has by default become one of the most widely used general-purpose programming languages, maybe _the_ most. However, like CSS, it can't undo mistakes in the design of the language (which was done, initially, in just 10 days) very often; in order to maintain backwards compatibility. Thankfully, also like CSS, JavaScript has made tremendous strides in the last 5-10 years in paving over the warts of the past with new features and getting them adopted across _most_ browsers so that, in 2021, it's quite nice to use.

## The very basics

For the very basics of JavaScript, I recommend this Scrimba course: [Introduction to JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/introtojavascript){:target="_blank"}. You should be able to watch it on 1.5x or 2x speed. Go ahead, I'll wait.

Welcome back! What did you think?

### This ain't your first rodeo

First of all, compare your experience learning JavaScript for the first time to when you learned Ruby for the first time. How did it feel this time around to learn about variables, string interpolation, arrays, arguments, `split`, etc?

So much easier, right? This was, for me, one of the best things about learning Ruby. After learning (the friendly, welcoming) Ruby and building some applications in Rails, and through that getting a pretty good understanding of programming _concepts_ (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, methods, arguments, etc) ‚Äî my second[^second_lang] language was _so much easier_, and the third was even easier still.

Conversely, every language has some distinct characteristics about it that will change the way you _think_ and make you better at your previous languages. Welcome to being a polyglot developer üôåüèæ 

[^second_lang]: This has hiring implications. _Really_ good developers can get up to speed on a new language pretty quickly (especially if it's a nice language like Ruby). If there are other developers on the team to answer questions about the codebase/framework while they are working on small introductory tasks, then it shouldn't be a dealbreaker that a strong developer has 0 years of experience in whatever stack you happen to be using, if they say they're willing to learn.

    Conversely, if a developer pigeonholes themselves as just a Rails developer or just a Node developer or just a React developer, then that's a red flag; they probably aren't very strong. (My opinion.)

### A review of some Ruby

I want to give you another introduction to JavaScript in a moment, with a specific focus on what we're going to need for our objective: making our web apps interactive and _slick_.

But first, it will be helpful to make sure you understand the following Ruby, so think about it carefully and [experiment with it in a workspace](https://github.com/appdev-projects/base-ruby/generate){:target="blank"} if you need to.
