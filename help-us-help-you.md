# How to ask a question

One of the most important takeaways from this course is how to frame your requests to reduce back-and-forth with developers. In other words: how to ask productive questions.

Whether you're asking your classmates and instructors for help with your homework, or requesting a bugfix from your team, it is always appreciated when you...

... help _us_ help _you_.

Please try to keep the following[^stack_overflow] in mind when you're asking questions:

## Asked and answered

Many times, your question has already been asked and answered. Scan the existing questions before you write up your question; even if your exact question isn't already there, you'll probably learn something.

To make easier for everyone to find relevant answers, when you are _asking_ questions:

 - Consider making the question **public** rather than private, unless it truly is something unique to only you (e.g. a request to swap sections is an appropriate thing to make private).

    Any question related to HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, Heroku, etc, will probably be helpful to more people than just you — you should make it public.
    
    You can make your question public and still choose to be anonymous to classmates, or anonymous to everyone. Feel free to do that.
 - To make it easier for others to find useful information when scanning the list of questions, it really helps to **write a good title**. See next section.

## Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

- Pretend you've bumped into an instructor in the hallway and have to **summarize your entire question in one sentence**: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions that have already been posted.
- If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, **write the title last** - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

Examples:

 - **Bad:** Math Confusion
 - **Good:** Why does `3/5` give `0`?
 - **Bad:** HW5 doubt
 - **Good:** How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data?
 - **Bad:** if else problems
 - **Good:** Why does `x` evaluate to `true` when `x = 0`?

## The Question Checklist

1. What project are you working on?
1. What action are you taking? e.g. "visiting /photos/4"
1. What behavior are you expecting?
1. What behavior is happening instead?
   - a screenshot is worth a thousand words
   - an [animated gif](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is worth a thousand screenshots
   - a detailed error message is worth a thousand gifs
     - Exception
     - Filename
     - Line number
     - Snippet of relevant code
     - Copy-paste the error message rather than screenshot it so that we can Google it easily
     - If you are Googling error messages yourself, try to cut out parts of it that might be unique to your project (e.g. the folder name). Keep it as short as possible while keeping it relevant for Google.
   - the server log for the request: what URL were you trying to access, which controller action processed it, what were the `params`?
 1. Make the subject line of the question descriptive, not just the name of the project, so that other students who are browsing can easily identify it.



1. It helps you think through the problem thoroughly, which often is enough to figure it out on your own. Almost all programming bugs are a mismatch between what you _think_ you're asking the computer do and what you're _actually_ asking the computer to do.
2. It gives us enough data upfront to make an educated guess about the problem and avoids a potentially time-consuming back-and-forth to gather all the relevant info.
